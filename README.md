Code to run the LEDs on the Wishing Well - Burner Art Project 2016

This is the code used to run the LEDs on the Wishing Well -- an art project built for That Thing At The Cabin VI in 2016. It will hopefully make it to deep playa at Burning Man in 2017. Here's a little short video of the well in action:

Code needs to be cleaned up, but we were under the gun time wise when we got to programming the actual patterns in the Well. The Well itself used two mirrors (infinity mirror effect) and 600 Dotstar LEDs that made 7 strips around the well.
